The Sudoku puzzle problem solving with Blind Search algorithm and Heuristic Search algorithm

Sudoku is a logic puzzle that consists of a 9×9 grid which is subdivided into nine other little grids of 3×3.
To each 3×3 grid is previously added numbers from 1 to 9. Together, the 'mini-grids' became row and column of the bigger grid.
The goal of the game is to fill the little grids with numbers from 1 to 9. However, each line, each column, and each 3x3 grid must contain one digit from 1 to 9 only once.
This is the implementation code part of the paper developmented to the Artificial Intelligence credits made for the Computer Applied Master degree.
